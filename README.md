# Navin_YTNUM-PS-2-
This is a Competition based project organized by Design Forge. Here we have been given problem statements for designing UI/UX based on the problem statement.

                                      >>>>    Dont Skip Reading of any Instruction Statement & Steps       <<<<

1. ðŸ¥‡Prototype Link: https://www.figma.com/proto/ginaGynTB7QxhNQM2md7fE/Youtube-IN?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=6-40&viewport=-1635%2C-1088%2C0.38&t=i1MqVaSRQsApngmL-1&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6%3A40

2. ðŸ¥ˆInstructions before opening the prototype:
   
  a. Note* its an actual prototype that means you can actually interact with the components.
  
  b. The resolution of the Frame is 1920x1080, so if your device is same resolution click on fit width on the upper right corner. else click Fill Screen for full view.
     Now Select on Keyboard Ctrl + \ to hide unwanted UI of Figma.

  c. Steps for prototype:
    i. Click on the expand button of youtube.

    ii. Click on the newly introduced icon (Switch Devices) once you enter the full screen of youtube.

    iii. Now a brand new UI enters the screen. For instructional help click on the '(?)' icon on top right of the screen.

         Now drag/swipe the icons from left to right of a device for actual initiation of the handover.

3. ðŸ¥‰The Actual Concept of the UI:
   Once the Swiping part is done an actual notification gets into that device via youtube notification (like a new video reminder of a creator to subscriber)
   After Accepting the Processing is completed and video starts playing from the same instance of the actual device to the new handovered device.
